
# Example 3: Modifying List Elements
# Lists in Python are mutable, meaning their values can be changed.
# You can modify an element by assigning a new value at a specific index.

# Example list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Modifying the first element
my_list[0] = 10

# Printing the modified list
print('Modified List:', my_list)
