# Example 1: Creating a Set
# A set is a collection of unique elements, created using curly braces {} or the set() function.
# Sets are unordered, meaning that their elements do not have a specific order.

# Creating a set with some elements
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 'Hello', 4}

# Printing the created set
print('Created Set:', my_set)
