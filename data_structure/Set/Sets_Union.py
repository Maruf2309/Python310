# Example 4: Set Union
# The union() method returns a new set containing all unique elements from both sets.
# You can also use the | operator to perform the union operation.

# Example sets
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

# Performing union
union_set = set1.union(set2)

# Printing the union set
print('Union of Sets:', union_set)
