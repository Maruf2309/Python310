# Example 1: Creating a Tuple
# A tuple is a collection of items, similar to a list, but it is immutable (cannot be changed).
# Tuples are created using parentheses ().

# Creating a tuple with various data types
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'Hello', (4, 5))

# Printing the created tuple
print('Created Tuple:', my_tuple)
