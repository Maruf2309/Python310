# Example 2: Accessing Tuple Elements
# Elements in a tuple are accessed using indices, similar to lists.
# Indexing starts from 0 (first element) and can also be negative (-1 for the last element).

# Example tuple
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Accessing elements using positive and negative indices
second_element = my_tuple[1]
last_element = my_tuple[-1]

# Printing accessed elements
print('Second Element:', second_element)
print('Last Element:', last_element)
