# Example 8: Checking Membership in a Tuple
# You can use the 'in' keyword to check if an element exists in a tuple.

# Example tuple
my_tuple = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')

# Checking for membership
if 'banana' in my_tuple:
    print('Banana is in the tuple')
else:
    print('Banana is not in the tuple')
