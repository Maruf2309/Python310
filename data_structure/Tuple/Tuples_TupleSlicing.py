# Example 6: Tuple Slicing
# Slicing allows you to extract a part of the tuple.
# It is done using a colon (:) to specify start, stop, and step indices.

# Example tuple
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Slicing the tuple from index 1 to 4
sliced_tuple = my_tuple[1:4]

# Printing the sliced tuple
print('Sliced Tuple:', sliced_tuple)
