# Example 4: Adding Elements to a Tuple
# Tuples are immutable, so you cannot add elements directly.
# However, you can create a new tuple by concatenating the existing one with another tuple.

# Example tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)

# Adding elements by creating a new tuple
my_tuple = my_tuple + (4,)

# Printing the updated tuple
print('Updated Tuple:', my_tuple)
